Adding new Customers and Products

Use your own file from last time of the file included to continue enhancing the app.  You will learn how to use window widgets and how to manage data between windows.

Part 2
Create new window widgets.  One window will add the fields so that the user can add a customer.  The other will be for products.

For the window widgets use the hide method so that they don't show up when the app loads

When the user types "Add/Edit" buttons, they should show the respective windows.

The window should populate the ID field from what the user already typed into the field in the main window.

When the user clicks the add button, it should append the product or customer to the Products or Customers list.

How should we fix it?

How do we handle issues that users might introduce without crashing the whole program?
